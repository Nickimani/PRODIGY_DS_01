# PRODIGY_DS_01

This is task involves visualizing the data to detect trends and patterns and possibly make inferences from the observations. Due to the records of the data being recorded annually, line plots are the best choice for visualizations. 

With the data avaliable we can ask questions like:

1. What is the trend of age dependency ratio? 
2. What is the trend of internet access by the population?
3. What is the trend of real GDP? 
4. What is the trend of population growth rate?
5. What is the trend of total population?
6. What is the gender composition of the population?
7. What is the rural-urban composition of the population?
8. What sort of correlations are there between these aspects of Kenya's population?

We delve into answering the questions above in a [Python notebook](https://github.com/Nickimani/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) and a [Tableau workbook](https://public.tableau.com/views/PRODIGY_DS_01/AgeDependency?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
